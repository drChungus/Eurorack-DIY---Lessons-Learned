It took me a few years to really grasp this idea, but here we go now. I am an engineer with a master's degree in mechatronics, so documenting my work is not a new thing for me. However, as modular synths and other fun electronic projects are basically a hobby for me I was not putting much effort into documenting those. Furthermore, I see people rather show off the end result of their work, but the endless nights of debugging and face-palming down the road are not often advertised. 
Building your own modules is tough, either you have previous experience with making such devices or not.

This way experiences of an individual can be easily shared out to shorten others' learning curve, helping them avoid mistakes already made and equip them with knowledge previously discovered.
